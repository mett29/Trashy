# Trashy
Project developed during the Xilinx Hackathon 2017 placed at Polytechnic of Milan.

Why is recycling so important?  I’m not going to explain you all the aspects of recycling, we all know that it is one of the best ways for you to have a positive impact on the world in which we live and that it is a very hot topic.

Nevertheless, the most significative thing is this --> “9 out of 10 people would recycle more if it were made easier."

That’s where we come in. We developed an automated recycling system which is able to recognize object, classify them and finally sort them in the equivalent container. Easy, but extremely powerful and useful!
